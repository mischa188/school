# Analysis on the relative frequency of the Saxon versus of genitive over time.

## General information
This project investigates grammatical simplification in English over time by comparing the relative frequency of two genitive constructions: the Saxon Genitive (’s) and the of-genitive. The study analyzes texts from the 19th century (1800–1849) and the 20th century (1950–1999) to determine whether English has shifted toward more analytical structures (relying on word order and prepositions) and away from synthetic ones (relying on inflection). The findings aim to contribute to our understanding of long term grammatical change in English.

## Background information
Several studies have examined the variation and historical development of genitive constructions in English:
**1:** Kreyer, (2003) found that the genitive used varies depending on the level of human involvement, and processability.

## Research question and hypotheses
**Research question:** How does the relative frequency of the Saxon Genitive ('s) and the of-genitive (of) in English texts differ between the texts
from the 19th century (1800-1849) and the 20st century (1950-1999)?
**Hypothesis:** Texts from the 20th century will use the of-genitive proportionally more often than texts from the 19th century.

##Analysis on the relative frequency of the Saxon versus of genitive over time.##

This project investigates grammatical simplification in English over time by comparing the relative frequency of two genitive constructions: the Saxon Genitive (’s) and the of-genitive. The study analyzes texts from the 19th century (1800–1849) and the 20th century (1950–1999) to determine whether English has shifted toward more analytical structures (relying on word order and prepositions) and away from synthetic ones (relying on inflection). The findings aim to contribute to our understanding of long term grammatical change in English.

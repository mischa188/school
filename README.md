# Analysis on the relative frequency of the Saxon versus of genitive over time.

## General information
This project investigates grammatical simplification in English over time by comparing the relative frequency of two genitive constructions: the Saxon Genitive (’s) and the of-genitive. The study analyzes texts from the 19th century (1800–1849) and the 20th century (1950–1999) to determine whether English has shifted toward more analytical structures (relying on word order and prepositions) and away from synthetic ones (relying on inflection). The findings aim to contribute to our understanding of long term grammatical change in English.

## Background information
Several studies have examined the variation and historical development of genitive constructions in English:

**1:** Kreyer, (2003) found that the genitive used varies depending on the level of human involvement, and processability.

**2:** Rosenbach (2008) analyzed the historical competition between the two genitive forms, noting a increase in the use of the of-genitive in written English, and again an importance of certain factors which decided which genitive was used more oftenly, being animacy, topicality and possesive relations.

## Research question and hypotheses

**Research question:** How does the relative frequency of the Saxon Genitive ('s) and the of-genitive (of) in English texts differ between the texts
from the 19th century (1800-1849) and the 20st century (1950-1999)?

**Hypothesis:** Texts from the 20th century will use the of-genitive proportionally more often than texts from the 19th century.

## Method

**Dataset:**
The study will use texts from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org), a digital library of public domain works.

**Time periods:**
19th century: 1800–1849
20th century: 1950–1999

**Sampling method:**
A random sample of 20 texts will be selected from each period, with each text containing roughly 500 words.
Only fiction and non-fiction books will be included to ensure comparability.
Texts will be limited to those originally written in English.

**Analysis:**
Frequencies will be normalized per 10.000 words to allow comparison across texts of varying lengths.
